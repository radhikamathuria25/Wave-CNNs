Conventional CNNs are susceptible to increased classification inaccuracy for due to errors induced while downsampling. This project is a comparative study of the conventional max-pooling based downsampling operations with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)- based downsampling operations for several networks using two quite distinct datasets. In our analysis, DWT-based downsampling proves to be highly effective for high-frequency images (high resolution fingerprints in this case) thus providing high classification accuracy.
